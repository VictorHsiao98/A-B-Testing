# A/B-Testing

In this repository on Experimentation, with a focus on A/B testing and online controlled experiments, I explore various experimental methodologies for detecting significance, including both parametric and non-parametric approaches. I delve into the principles of experimental design, particularly the mathematics behind determining minimum sample size, and provide actionable insights and recommendations for business scenarios to drive optimal performance.
